# Security Policy — KindPath Collective

We take security seriously, especially where systems touch community wellbeing, sensitive context, or governance workflows.

## Supported scope
This policy applies to:
- Code and tooling in KindPath repositories
- Website deployments and public infrastructure (where applicable)
- Configuration issues that expose secrets, credentials, or private data

## Please do NOT
- Open a public Issue for vulnerabilities that could be exploited
- Post credentials, API keys, tokens, or private data in public threads

## How to report a vulnerability
Email:
- **sam@kindpathcollective.org**
Subject line:
- **[SECURITY] <short description>**

Include:
- Where the issue is (repo + file/path + version/commit if possible)
- Impact (what could happen if exploited)
- Reproduction steps (proof-of-concept if safe)
- Any suggested mitigation or patch ideas (optional)

## What happens next
We will:
- Acknowledge receipt
- Assess severity and scope
- Coordinate a fix and a responsible disclosure plan

## Responsible disclosure
Please give us a reasonable window to investigate and patch before public disclosure.
If you believe users are at immediate risk, say so clearly in your report.

## Thanks
If you report responsibly, you’re helping protect people — and we appreciate it.
