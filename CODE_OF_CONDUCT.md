# Code of Conduct — KindPath Collective

## Our intent
KindPath exists to build practical, evidence-led tools for ecological and social regeneration.  
That only works if we keep this space safe, constructive, and worth showing up to.

## Our standards
We will:
- Be direct **without** being degrading
- Critique ideas with **evidence**, not personal attacks
- Assume good intent, ask questions before making accusations
- Keep people safe: no harassment, threats, doxxing, or intimidation
- Respect lived experience while staying accountable to facts
- Protect the vulnerable and avoid blame cycles

## Unacceptable behavior
Examples include:
- Harassment, hate speech, discrimination, or sexualized language
- Personal attacks, mockery, or deliberate humiliation
- Threats of violence or encouragement of self-harm
- Publishing private information (doxxing)
- Persistent bad-faith disruption (“I’m just asking questions” used as a weapon)

## Moderation philosophy
We prefer **repair over punishment**, but we will protect the space.
Maintainers may:
- Ask for edits or a change in tone
- Remove content that violates this code
- Temporarily or permanently restrict participation when needed

## Reporting & enforcement
If something feels off, report it.
- Contact: **sam@kindpathcollective.org**
- Please include: link(s), screenshots if relevant, and what outcome you’re seeking.

## Scope
This applies to all KindPath spaces on GitHub:
- Repositories, issues, pull requests
- Discussions, comments, reviews
- Any interaction under the KindPath Collective umbrella

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is inspired by common open collaboration standards, adapted to KindPath values.
